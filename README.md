# Application of Finite Automata

 DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) for a Simple Sequential Calculator: This system reads and evaluates a string consisting of digits, operators (+, -, *, /), and other characters. The DFA processes the input one character at a time, checking whether each is valid (a digit or operator) and transitions between states accordingly. It accumulates numbers and performs arithmetic operations as the input is parsed. Invalid characters or sequences transition the DFA to a reject state, while valid sequences are accepted and dynamically computed, providing the total result.
